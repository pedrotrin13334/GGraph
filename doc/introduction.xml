<Index>The Graph defined on Groups Package</Index>
The GGraph is a &GAP; package dedicated to implement methods,
functions and constructions for different types of graphs defined
on groups.  
<P/>
To utilize the GGraph package, it is necessary to download it from the 
main GGraph repository in github to the <A>.gap/pkg</A> directory, then type in
the console: 
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[

If the GAP system outputs true, then everything went well and you can readily 
utilize the GGraph methods, functions and variables.
